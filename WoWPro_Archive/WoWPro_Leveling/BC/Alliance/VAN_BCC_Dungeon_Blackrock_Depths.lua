N About the guide|QID|3802|N|Blackrock Depths is a huge dungeon and has many different ways you can go, it is not on rails like other dungeons, so for writing a guide that needs to have things done in a certain order is challenging if not impossible. So the main goal here is to get you setup with all the available quests before you go in. I will still put guide steps in the dungeon, but if your group has other plans and doesn't want to follow this route then you may have to skip around and/or reset the guide a lot.\n\nIdeally you will have a group that wants to come in and get quests done, or friends/guildies willing to help you out, and not a group that strictly wants to do a quick Emperor run.\n\nIf you can't get it all done in the first go then it's alright, we mainly want to get you to about halfway into 55 before you start Chapter IV. If you've met that goal by the end of the dungeon run then it was a success.\n\nIf you are coming from Chapter 3, then you should already have 11 quests, this dungeon has 10 if you grab them all, fortunately you will turn 1 of them in but that means all 20 quest slots will be in use for a period of time. If you have some lingering quests that aren't part of the guides I would suggest finishing them up or dropping them.|

Otherwise you will need to do a 2nd run to finish this up (and probably a third or fourth to do Jailbreak).\n\nManually skip this step to continue.|

K Fineous Darkvire|QID|3802|M|50,50|N|Kill Fineous Darkvire and loot Ironfel.\n\nDirections:\nFrom the hallway you were in for Kharan and Windsor, take your next right, eastern side of the big area, and then a quick left into the Ring of Law.\n\nAfter you do that, run through the now open gate on the west side and up the ramp to the 2nd level. Make your way across to the other (Eastern) side of the Ring to the next hallway. Go south and Kill Pyromancer Loregrain to have the way to the Monument cleared.\n\nRun back up north until you reach the big open area with Incendius/Black Forge down below. Drop down and kill him. You will find Fineous to the Northeast in the next room. He paths up and down the whole section there.|L|10999|

C The Heart of the Mountain|QID|4123|M|50,50|US|N|With Fineous dead, continue running up the ramp through this room until you're back up on the level you were before jumping down for Incendius. Before going out the way you came in, there is an area to the left (South on map) That leads to the Vault. There may be a rare boss here, Stilgiss and Verek, if so kill them.\n\nNow before you proceed, you need to make sure you have 11 coffer keys between your group. If you don't then this will have to wait for a future run, or backtrack later on once you get more keys. If that is the case just manually skip this step for now.\n\nIf you have the keys, start opening the coffers, enjoy the loot inside. Don't open the last one. Once all 11 are open it will spawn a group of golems and dark irons. Once they're dead a secret vault will open with the heart of the mountain. Only 1 person at a time can get it, but it will respawn after about 10 seconds.|

T Dark Iron Legacy|QID|3802|M|50,50|N|To Monument of Franclorn Forgewright.\n\nDirection:\nIf you don't remember where Loregrain was, from coffer room, go back out to the open area and stick to the left to the entryway you originally came in at before Incendius (West side on map) then continue to run south across the bridge, all the way down to the Monument. You will get the Shadowforge Key!|PRE|3801|

K Bael'Gar|QID|4024|M|50,50|N|Kill Bael'Gar and then use the molt to capture his essence.\n\nDirections:From the Monument, run back north and swing into the first left back into the Ring of Law. Jump down into the arena and exit south through the original way you came in, making your way west back to the entrance.\n\nNow at the entrance, use your newly acquired Shadowforge Key to open the door (North on the map). Once through the door, head north but keep a mental note of the other door to your right as that is where we go after this. At the Fork, go Northwest, there are lots of pats and groups so be careful. Once you get to the end you will find Bael'Gar. Once he's dead, target his corpse and click on the molt to collect his essence.|U|11231|L|11230|

R West Garrison|QID|4126|M|50,50|N|Back toward the entrance, find the door I said to make note of that leads to the East Garrison. In that room there is a giant wheel with a lock under it you click to open the doors that will otherwise block your way. Make your way back up the steps into the next room.\n\nGo Northeast and follow the archway over to the other side until you reach the West Garrison where you will find General Angerforge down south and Golem Lord Argelmach up north.|
K General Angerforge|ACTIVE|4282|M|50,50|QO|1|N|Kill General Angerforge and loot the lost information.\n\nStrategy:\nAngerforge is simple enough but he has a few adds to deal with. At the end he will summon a bunch of help that will run to his rescue, be prepared for lots of AOE toward the end.|
K Golem Lord Argelmach|ACTIVE|4282|M|50,50|QO|2|N|Kill Golem Lord Argelmach and loot the lost information.\n\nStrategy:\nTake out the Golems first, once they are out the way the fight is pretty simple.|

K Hurley Blackbreath|QID|4126|M|50,50|QO|1|N|Kill Hurley Blackbreath and loot his recipe.\n\nDirections:\nAfter killing General Angerforge down south and Golem Lord Argelmach up north within the West Garrison, make your east toward the Grim Guzzler. Once there, goto a room full of barrels to your left (Northwest on map). And there should be 3 barrels to interact with. Once you destroy all 3, Hurley and crew will come at you. Fight and kill them in that room.|
K Ribbly Screwspigot|QID|4136|M|50,50|QO|1|N|Kill Ribbly Screwspigot and loot his head.\n\nStay in the same room you killed Hurley in. Ribbly is just outside the room to your left.

C Attunement to the Core|ACTIVE|7848|M|50,50|N|To get out of the Grim Guzzler you need to buy ale from Plugger Spazzing and give them to Private Rocknot. This will cause Phalanx to agro, fight him in the corner next to the door. Once you go through the door you will find yourself in the circle room where you found Incendius before, but opposite side. Take the hall to your left (Northwest on map) and make your way to kill Flamelash.\n\nContinue Northwest into the Mold Foundry where you can sometimes find the rare boss Panzor. Go Northeast into the Summoners Tomb and fight the Council of Seven by speaking to Doom'rel to open the door.\n\nOnce out the newly opened door, to the southeast you will see the Molten Core entrance. The fragment you need is located to the left side, a grey long rock you can click on.|

K Emperor Dagran Thaurissan|ACTIVE|4362|M|50,50|QO|1|N|Kill Dagran Thaurissan.\n\nDirections:\nAt the door that opened after fighting The Seven, go Northeast into the Lyceum. This area is a gauntlet and lots of mobs agro and respawn quickly. You need to find the 2 Shadowforge Flame Keepers to loot their torches. Once you have the torches, there are 2 Braizers at the northeast and southeast areas of the room. This will unlock the door to the east that you then go through and will face the boss Magmus.\n\nAfter you defeat magmus continue east toward the Imperal Seat where you will find Thaurissan and Moira.|
