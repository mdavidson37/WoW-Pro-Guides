N Higher Learning|N|This guide will help you to get the Higher Learning achievement. It requires you to read a number of books in Dalaran. These books appear in fixed places, but often get replaced by a non-achievement-related book. Once you have read one of them (even the non-achievement-related ones), they disappear after a few minutes and you have to wait 3-4 hours before the next book appears in that location. So if you find a "wrong" book at one of the locations in this guide, you need to read it anyway and come back 3-4 hours later.|
N Note of caution|N|Despite these steps showing a yellow "!" in the guide, you do not actually need to accept a quest or see a "!" over the books.|
